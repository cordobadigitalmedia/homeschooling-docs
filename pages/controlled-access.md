# Controlled Computer Access

## Approach
There are many ways to manage computer and mobile device access for your children. Based on the book [Wired Child](https://richardfreed.com/wired-child/), we have decided to allow controlled access to computers with no smart phones. Once the child is financially able and responsible, they may get their own smart phone or device.

## Enabling Controlled Access
Find below the guidelines for computer access. This applies specially if your child needs to access the computer every day for many hours for online schooling.
- Create standard accounts (not full administrator accounts) so that only the administrator is able to set the Network settings for safe browing tools like cleanbrowsing.
- Set timed access so that children can log between specific times every day as well as maximum number of allowed hours per day. We use older versions of the Mac Operating system and this worked very well for us with **Parental Controls**. 
  - Mac: This [guide](https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/set-up-parental-controls-mac-3780629/) shows how to set up either **Parental Controls** (older macs - Mojave and earlier) or **Screen Time** (newer macs).
  - Windows: This [guide](https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-family-safety-parental-controls-4153037) shows how to set up **Parental Controls** on **Windows 10**. 
- All computers are in a common environment like the school room with screens facing the center of the room.
